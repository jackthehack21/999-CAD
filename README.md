999 Computer Aided Dispatch Simulator by Jackthehack21 (JaxkDev/Jackthehaxk21)

### About
**Computer-aided dispatch (CAD)**, also called computer-assisted dispatch, is a method of dispatching taxicabs, couriers, field service technicians, mass transit vehicles or emergency services assisted by computer. 

It can either be used to send messages to the dispatcher via a mobile data terminal (MDT) and/or used to store and retrieve data (i.e. radio logs, field interviews, client information, schedules, etc.). 

A dispatcher may announce the call details to field units over a two-way radio. 

Some systems communicate using a two-way radio system's selective calling features. 

CAD systems may send text messages with call-for-service details to alphanumeric pagers or wireless telephony text services like SMS. 

The central idea is that persons in a dispatch center are able to easily view and understand the status of all units being dispatched. 

CAD provides displays and tools so that the dispatcher has an opportunity to handle calls-for-service as efficiently as possible.

### Dependencies:
- [Python@3.7.3](https://www.python.org/) : Main language used for whole program.
- [Wxpython@4.0.6](https://pypi.org/project/wxPython/4.0.6/) : Main wrapper for all GUI you see.
- [Fasteners@0.15.0](https://pypi.org/project/fasteners/0.15/) : Allows file locking on Windows (used to stop multiple process's that corrupt data)
- [PyInstaller@3.4.0](https://pypi.org/project/pyinstaller/3.4/) : Cross platform compile to one file for deployment

### Other
This app is very small right now its sort of my little experiment on using different GUI library's 
i hope i can make something decent out of this but please remember there's only one person doing this in their free time.

Hope someone finds it useful.
